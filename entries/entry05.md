# Where I am at
I am currently adding on to my Mvp until the expo day where i will present what i have to the other students. I have currently changed the physics to make the game a little bit harder by making gravity bigger so that you barely reach each platform, I have changed the "enemy" into a garbage bag to represent the theme of pollution, i have changed the points to emission with an image of smoke, i have made the uder/character an earth themed character, i changed the score you get for each air colected, i changed the "world" and i changed the Platforms. I also ran into a problem with the proportions where the user would lose even if the garbage bag didnt touch them. All the images i said above i created in pixil art so that they still had the same acrade/8-bit sortve vibe of the world and "story". I also changed the start and end screen i made prior and i plan on adding them in the near future as i tried for a bit but it didnt want to work but i will attempt again after i make the world "move" as said in the previous blog as that is my main focus. Before i present i want to have the tower functionality there to make it unique and i am currently still tinkering to get it to work as it didnt work with what i had in my mind whish was by changing the location of the same platform.

# EDP 
I would say i am still on the 7th step of the engineering design process as i am getting closer to my final product but i am still a short way from my final presentable product. all i need to do is add the functionality and correctly add the end/start screen which would fully make my product complete.

# Skills
One skill i believe i strengthened is my Creativity skills as i was able to create my own little art and make the characters unique as i wanted it to match the idea i had in my mind of a little character helping protect the planet from various types of harm from pollution to littering. The skill of being creative can positively affect everyone in every acpect as it helps you in projects(get more creativity points) and it can help you in day to day tasks(helping special people out). Another skill i think i have strengthened is my "story telling"/my pitch as i feel like the story i have prepared when i have to present my project will greatly show what my mindset was in the project and that it connects the audience to my Point of view.
what i have after finishing this blog is in a video here [video](https://youtu.be/-umP_nR5ltI)
