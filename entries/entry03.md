## Context
For the past 6 weeks I have been working very hrd on p5js to get a better understanding on how we could use javascript to sortve interact wih other "shaps and elements" in order to help me better prepare for phazer. I was able to create a house like structure with the knowledge I have of p5js and I was alo able to code a project where different elemens ike balls and squares and images can bounce and interact with each other. I have spent most of my time re-learning certain aspect of Phaser and what certain code snippets do as I took a break from coding during the winter break and have slowly been learning it back with the help of p5.js as they are very similar and both are very useful right now. Although I havent really coded anything close to a prototype or related to the actual theme of the Project I can confidently say I have a final idea on what the project will look lie. It will be an "asteroids"/"galaga" type game where the user will be in a jetpack with a nuclear suit and the main objective is to destroy both trash being thrown into the air and to catch clouds of emission in order to help protect the planet. I already have some background images chosen and I plan to make the "trash" that will be destroyed(with an 8-bit sortve style). What i feel i have strenghtened in this field is that I have a way better understanting on what does what. I learned that ``` var game = new Phaser.Game(config); ``` creates the "game space " with the functions preload, preloading certain items so that they function properly when loading up the game and update constantly updates the game making everything run smoother. I also have a better understanding that you can change various things about the game such as the dimensions, frame rate, the times they repeat and their actual weight/speed.





# Engineering design process 

After re-initiating a tinkering "period" I would say that I am on step 5 of the engineering design process as I have a clearer image on what the game will both look like and play out in the long run. I have also currently contain the knowlege on how to load sprites and have them interact and update. I will slowly build up to that finished prototype but right this monday I plan to create an mvp that will have the background that I have chosen and a character that destroys random elements when they touch as that would be a great mvp since it would work and it would be related to the image I have in my head without going "all in" where I could mess up and would have to restart various times.


# Skills

During this new time period id say a skill I have greatly strenghthened is perseverance as there where many moments where my code didnt work whhile I followed the various walkthroughs and [tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBALBdA18_M). The main error that I encountered was that my image wouldnt load up whilst I was using the correct syntax and the correct File name. This left me stumped for a while as nothing would load up for a while despite attempting various times by changing the file name, but after a while I realized I put the wrong "path" to the actual image file and quickly changed it so that it would end up in the img folder that container the image. This kindove sets me for the future problems that I will face whilst making the actual big project.

Another skill I feel I have strenghtened is my skill to learn. I have gone through countless hours of videos for [js games](https://academy.zenva.com), [phaser games](https://phaser.io/examples/v3), [haser tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Q5jP85PXrE) and just basic javascript and p5 videos to help me make my actual game. Watching all these videos help me better understand both how we can implement js to make a video game but also on how we can make it interactive and fun for the user all while being sortve first draft. In the future this will greatly pay off as I would have a bigger knowledge of whatever i do and one example of this could be in Ap classroom where I watch videos which prepare me for the big end of year Ap exam(like a final product) but also help me greatly for smaller teacher given tests(like an mvp).
