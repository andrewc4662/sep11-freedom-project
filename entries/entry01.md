For this years Freedom project we are tasked to make a creation using both our imagination and the wonderful powers of javascript. Using [Javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/What_is_JavaScript), [MelonJs](http://melonjs.github.io/melonJS/docs/) and maybe Firebase I will create a website and video game spreading awarness on the growing problem that is [pollution](https://www.who.int/health-topics/air-pollution#tab=tab_1) in order to help stop the problem by changing the pov of peaople on the subject. Pollution is when various harmful greenhouse gasses enterthe air and damage our ozone layer which is vital to all life on earth as it protects us from the deadly and dangerous rays which the sun radiates. My plan is to help people understand the problem at hand and maybe be careful with their emission rate to understyand that all together we could help lower the rate at which pollution is being emitted with events such as the limiting of car use as they release several harmful gasses into the atmosphere. I decided on melon.js because I wanted to make a "super mario" type of game where the user has to destroy different items that emit alot of greenhouse gasses in order to save the planet. I pondered about using firebase because I could get some of the user data to show on a map thier geological loctations emission rates on something similar to a map to add some personalization to the site.

## EDP 

I would say that I am currently on level 2 of the engineering design [process](https://hstatsep.github.io/students/#edp) because I oculd define the problem I am trying to solve but I would need to research it a little more and keep researching/tinkering with Firebase and Melon.js. I feel like I am very close to 3 as I have brainstormed a little bit but with more research i will lock in what type of game I will create.


## Skills

I have greatly strenghthened in 2 skills throughout the past weeks of our freedom project classes. For example I felt like my creativity skills improved as there is no real problem to solve or what to do so I get to think of various things to accomplish to show what I would love to share with the community. I feel like this could help me in future projects or when doing community projects as I would be able to express myself and my ideas better.

Another skill I have strengthened is my problem solving skills as Ive had to do a lot to understand bits of javascript and ive greatly learned through trial and error which has helped me greatly understand a js catagory called functions. The problem solving can help me in the future when I eventually face hard problems where I would have to think hard in order to solve the said problems and using the technique of trial and error would greatly save me in those scenarios.
