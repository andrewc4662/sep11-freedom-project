## Implications

My project affects various areas and in all of the areas, they are positive impacts helping Socially, economically and globally.


### Global 
This game positively affects everyone on a glabal level as it takes aim at helping the enviorment by spreading awarenss on the growing problem of pollution so that we could lower our emission levels as a whole. This might make a small difference but any effort or slight change is a big imact even if it seems little.


### Social
On a social level this game helps individuals who are bored or sterss sortve de-stress and take their minds off of the stressfull worl to just relax for a bit.



### Economic
Economically this game could be very impactful as it could lead to widespread action against emission laws and regulations which can shift the world to a more eco friendly world where we watch our emission levels very closely.
