## Elevator Pitch & Expo
When it was my time to present my Project I felt as if I did a really good job and showed my mindset and my project to the fullest. I was able to intriue the judges with my elevator pitch which was aimed at the story behind my project and with this I knew I could elevate my project and its meaning. I was also able to graby the attention of other various teahers, students and newer Sep members which made me feel great as i was able to share my love and knowledge of code to various others and which could be why I was ranked very high.


## In class presentation
My in class presentation went splendid as I felt like I informed the audience as much as I could but I felt like i couldve said more. I deleted some slides in order so that the presentation was shorter, faster so that it wouldt lose the audiences interest but i feel like i couldve said more if i just kept it simple.
