## Elevator Pitch & Expo
When it was my time to present my Project I felt as if I did a really good job and showed my mindset and my project to the fullest. I was able to intriue the judges with my elevator pitch which was aimed at the story behind my project and with this I knew I could elevate my project and its meaning. I was also able to graby the attention of other various teahers, students and newer Sep members which made me feel great as i was able to share my love and knowledge of code to various others and which could be why I was ranked very high.


## In class presentation
My in class presentation went splendid as I felt like I informed the audience as much as I could but I felt like i couldve said more. I deleted some slides in order so that the presentation was shorter, faster so that it wouldt lose the audiences interest but i feel like i couldve said more if i just kept it simple.

# Skills
Throughout the year I have strengthened various skills and learned some new ones. During the past few weeks I have gained some important skills which inclide Public speaking skills and the ability to work under pressure. I strengthened my public speaking skills as i had to present my project to various students and teachers at the expo and i had to present my project to my fellow classmates in our classroom. This helped me as i felt very nervous before presenting(to the point i had a high heart rate) but i still went up and presented. This presentation made me feel more comfortable with presenting and i feel that after that, i can present to more people and in bigger areas. Another skill i felt i learned was working under pressure as ive had to quickly adapt to questions asked about my  project which I wouldnt be prepared for/ expecting and doing so in real time made me feel like i am better at answering questions and adapting to my enviorment.



# EDP
I would say that i am currently on step 7 of the engineering design process as i have to improve some things in my game and after that i would be ready to communicate my results with other peers and code enthusiasts.
